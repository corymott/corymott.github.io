Created in 2022, Sbarra Italiano is a brand new, state of the art sports bar and authentic Italian restaraunt combination. A family owned and operated business, owner Ricardo Esposito created Sbarra Italiano to bring together his two main loves in life: sports and authentic Italian cuisine.
</p>

<h2>About the Owner</h2>

<p>
Ricardo Esposito was born in Naples, Italy where he grew up with a father who was a chef and owned his own restaraunt. Ricardo began working in the kitchen at the age of only 13, where he studied under his father and his sous chef learning the basics of kitchen hygiene, food preparation, and general kitchen mechanics. After turning 18, Ricardo moved his life to the United States to attend the Culinary Institute of America. Applying his knowledge learned from his father restaraunt, Ricardo went on to graduate and worked in two Michelin star restaraunts. After 20 years in the industry, Ricardo decided it is time to bring his own restaraunt to life, and Sbarra Italiano was born.
</p>

<h2>Mission Statement</h2>

<p>
The mission of Sbarra Italiano is to bring the world of sports and authentic Italian food together in one spirited restaraunt. This will be achieved with a state of the art sports bar, combined with an authentic Italian kitchen featuring well trained Italian chefs providing the highest quality of Italian food in the area, all at an affordable price.
